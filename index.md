# Dear Auditor,

Dear Auditor,
We realize that we have been changing things in a rapid fashion from Agile and DevOps to Cloud and Containers. We have been busy, and we have had great success as companies are delivering faster than ever and able to respond to business needs. (TK: Insert DevOps Survey stats). This isnâ€™t just icing on the cake, the only sustainable advantage in our industry now is the ability to meet customer demands faster, more scalable, more reliably than our competitors and companies not working in this way are losing market share and shareholder value.

But, with all this growth, we made a huge mistake. We forgot to bring you along for the ride. That is totally our bad, but we want to make it right. We want to make a new commitment.

As we work closer together you will be exposed to some of our practices which may seem silly or even counterintuitive.  The DevOps community has been experimenting quite a bit over the last number of years and common practice represents the collective wisdom across many companies, industries, and countries.
